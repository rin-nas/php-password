# PHP library for the password

## Features and advantages

1. Quality checking (complexity) password
1. Generation of high-quality and resistant to cracking password
1. A method that returns derivatives from the password to be able to log in (authorization), regardless of keyboard layout (language input) and pressing [Caps Lock] or [Shift] buttons.
Security remark. The method returns the only a few password forms for a successful log in (authorization) possibility. It's too little against the billions combinations of high-quality passwords. However, the usefulness of this feature may be condemned by some critics.
